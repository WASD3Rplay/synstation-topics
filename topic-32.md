## 🏙️ Will ETHGlobal Host a Hackathon in Dubai in 2026?

ETHGlobal has never hosted a hackathon in Dubai, despite the city being a major hub for the crypto community and regarded as one of the top crypto cities in the world. The question remains: are there enough builders to support hosting one there?

### 💡 Why This Topic?
- 🌍 **Dubai’s Crypto Momentum**  
  Dubai is home to major Web3 conferences and startups, but still lacks an ETHGlobal presence.
- 🏗️ **World-Class Infrastructure**  
  With top-tier venues, air travel access, and government support, Dubai is highly prepared to host global builders.
- 🧑‍💻 **Community Interest**  
  Builders across MENA and beyond are ready—ETHGlobal just needs to show up.

### 📜 Market Rules
- ✅ **YES Resolution**  
  The market resolves to **YES** if ETHGlobal officially announces and lists a hackathon event in **Dubai** scheduled for any date in **2026**.
- ❌ **NO Resolution**  
  The market resolves to **NO** if no such announcement is made by ETHGlobal by the resolution date.
- 🔄 **Exceptional Circumstances**
